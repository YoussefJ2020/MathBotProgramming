# MathBotProgramming

All the program files related to Math Bot Programming (note: this may not be the permanent repository).
All method names should be written in CamelCase (ex: camelCase), Non-method variable names should be written in Pascal Case (ex: PascalCase)

## Goals For This Month

-   Make basic functionality of the bot in Java
-   Optimize algorithms for common math operations
-   Remake MathBot using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

## Functionality

-   Basic Arithmetic
-   Statistics
-   Polynomial Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Factoring, Solving)

    **Note**: This is not by any means a complete list; more features will be added as time goes on.
